This is my new personal blog, https://blog.whal.ing.  It lives on github here: [https://www.github.com/rwhaling/blog.whal.ing](https://www.github.com/rwhaling/blog.whal.ing).  I manage it with Obsidian and render/publish it to Github Pages with Quartz.  I'll write more about what it does as I go.

For now, you can see the most recent posts in the column to the right, or here: [blog](blog)
